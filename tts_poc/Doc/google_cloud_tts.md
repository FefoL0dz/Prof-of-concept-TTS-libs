# Google Cloud TTS Provider Implementation Guide

This document explains how to set up and use the **GoogleCloudTtsProvider** in the TTS POC project.

## Prerequisites
1. A Google Cloud account with the **Text‑to‑Speech API** enabled.
2. A **Service Account JSON** key file with the `cloudtts` permission.
3. The JSON file should be placed in `assets/credentials.json` (the project already references this path).

## Step‑by‑Step
1. **Create Service Account**
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console → IAM & Admin → Service Accounts.
   - Create a new service account (e.g., `tts‑service‑account`).
   - Grant the role **Text‑to‑Speech Admin**.
   - Generate a key in JSON format and download it.
2. **Add the JSON to the project**
   - Copy the downloaded file to `tts_poc/assets/credentials.json`.
   - Ensure the `pubspec.yaml` includes the asset:
   ```yaml
   flutter:
     assets:
       - assets/credentials.json
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables (optional)**
   - The provider reads the credentials from the asset, but you can also pass the path via `--dart-define=GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=assets/credentials.json` when running the app.
4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   The provider will be automatically instantiated by `TtsProviderRegistry` and appear in the dropdown.

## Verification
- Select **Google Cloud** from the provider dropdown.
- Choose a voice and press **Speak**.
- You should hear synthesized speech generated by Google Cloud.
